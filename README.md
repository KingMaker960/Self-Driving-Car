# Self Driving Car
##Abstract
Self-Driving Car, in general, is a hardware and software-based project which is specifically designed to revolutionize transportation and address various challenges. This project aims to create an autonomous system capable of navigating its surroundings without human intervention. To achieve this goal, real-time visual data from the Pi camera will be analyzed, and computer vision algorithms developed with OpenCV will be used.

The project consists of three key parts: hardware configuration, software creation, and algorithm execution. The Raspberry Pi will act as the main computing platform, offering the required processing speed and interfaces for integrating sensors. The Pi camera will serve as the main visual sensor, continuously taking pictures of the surroundings around the car. Various Computer vision techniques, including picture segmentation, object detection, and tracking, will be used to process and evaluate these images. The Arduino then uses a variety of signals produced by the Pi to trace and control the movement of the automobile in its surroundings.

The self-driving car's potential uses go beyond the purview of this project. It can be applied in numerous domains where autonomous navigation is required, such as transportation, industrial automation, surveillance, and many more.
